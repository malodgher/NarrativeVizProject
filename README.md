## Developer's Note:
This project imports script.js as **module** in index.html, not as text/javascript. Please remember to run this code in a server, such as LiveServer on Visual Studio Code, when doing development and testing. If you try to load the HTML file locally (i.e. with a `file://` URL), you'll run into CORS errors due to JavaScript module security requirements.
